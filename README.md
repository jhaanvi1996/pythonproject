In this project, we'll work in the Jupyter environment. Jupyter is a widely used data science environment that combines a rich 
text editor with a console. The Jupyter project was originally called IPython, and focused on supporting just the Python language.
Over time, support for other languages like R and Julia were added and the project was renamed to Jupyter.

Jupyter notebook is built around a typical data analysis workflow and it's very different from a standard integrated development 
environment, such as Pycharm, which focus more on just working with code. In Jupyter, you work with notebooks, which mix plain text, 
code, and code outputs in one view. 

Notebooks allow you to interleave code and text explanations, enabling you to easily explore data, create visualizations, and share 
your results. Jupyter is widely used in data science, scientific research, and other applications where it's important to be able to 
explain the methodology.
